# Problem 01: Total Revenue Analysis

## Business Question
What is the total revenue generated by the business?

---

## Thinking (Business Context)
The finance team wants to understand total revenue to evaluate overall business performance.
Cancelled orders and returns should not be included in revenue calculations.

---

## Assumptions
- Cancelled invoices start with 'C'
- Negative or zero quantities are excluded
- Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price

---

## SQL Approach
1. Filter valid transactions
2. Calculate revenue per line item
3. Aggregate total revenue

---

## SQL Query
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM online_retail
WHERE invoice_no NOT LIKE 'C%'
  AND quantity > 0
  AND unit_price > 0;
