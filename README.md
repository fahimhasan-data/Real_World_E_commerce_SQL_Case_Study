# Real World E-Commerce SQL Case Study

## Overview

This repository presents a real-world e-commerce SQL case study where I solve practical business problems using PostgreSQL. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights through structured analysis and well-written SQL queries.

Each problem includes:

- Clear business context  
- Defined problem statement  
- Business reasoning  
- SQL solution  
- Actionable business insight  

This project demonstrates applied SQL skills in a realistic analytical environment.
