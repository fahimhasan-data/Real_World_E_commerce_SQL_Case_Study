# Problem 01: Total Revenue Analysis (Validated Business KPI)

---

## 1. Business Objective

Determine the total valid revenue generated by the business to establish a reliable financial baseline for performance evaluation and strategic planning.

Revenue is a core KPI used to:

- Evaluate business scale
- Monitor financial health
- Support forecasting
- Compare performance across time periods

---

## 2. Business Context

The raw dataset contains transactional records including cancellations and returns. 

If revenue is calculated without proper validation:
- Financial performance will be overstated
- Strategic decisions may be based on incorrect data
- Reporting accuracy will be compromised

Therefore, we must define and compute **validated gross revenue**.

---

## 3. Revenue Definition

For this analysis:

Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price

Only valid completed transactions should be included.

---

## 4. Data Validation & Assumptions

To ensure accuracy, the following filters are applied:

- Exclude cancelled invoices (InvoiceNo starting with 'C')
- Exclude negative or zero quantities
- Exclude zero or negative unit prices
- Assume each row represents a transaction line item

This ensures we measure actual realized sales.

---

## 5. Analytical Strategy

Step 1: Remove invalid transactions  
Step 2: Calculate revenue at line-item level  
Step 3: Aggregate total revenue  

This structured approach prevents miscalculation and improves financial reliability.

## 6. SQL Implementation

```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(quantity * unit_price), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM online_retail
WHERE invoice_no NOT LIKE 'C%'
  AND quantity > 0
  AND unit_price > 0;
